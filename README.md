### Hi there, I'm Clayton and this is my GitHub profile 👋

**I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with experience in Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I have a diverse background in business ownership and the creative arts. From my background I bring with me the ability to communicate, collaborate, lead, and problem solve. I am solution oriented and I have a propensity for delivering quality products on schedule. I have a drive to continually learn and improve, a capacity to envision the future, and a knack for achieving goals through dedication.

**I'm hoping to participate in the software industry in a way that makes the web a more sustainable place for art and creativity as well as a more accessible and inclusive place for marginalized groups. I’m excited about integrating my drive and work ethic into a career in software development. Away from coding I enjoy making music 🎸, film photography 📸, and taking road trips into the unknown 🏔.
