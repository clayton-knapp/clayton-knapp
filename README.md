### Hi there, I'm Clayton and this is my GitHub profile 👋

I am a Full-Stack Software Developer with experience in Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, and Supabase. I love data architecture, an organized file hierarchy, and clean code. I have a diverse background in business ownership in multiple industries. From my experience I bring with me the ability to communicate, collaborate, lead, and problem solve. I am solution oriented and I know what it means to deliver a good value product. I work well in large teams or solo. I have a thirst for new tech and I am constantly embracing a beginner’s mindset. I’m looking forward to creating software that solves human centered problems and I’m excited about integrating my drive and work ethic into a career in software development. Away from coding I enjoy making music, film photography, and taking road trips to the unknown.
